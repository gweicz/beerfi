# üçªBeerFi Prague
> Web3 on-chain dev meetup

Every Tuesday on the last week of the month, we bring together programmers in Web3. Whether you are a Web2 developer interested to learn more or a senior in the Web3 sphere, our meetup is for you!

The meetup is focused on contract development. Very tech stuff - down to the byte code. Not frontends and JS Frameworks - there are other meetups for those.

Example topics will be comparison of proxies, their gas, size, ect. Other talks will be about cross chain / layer calls, blind signing, security, clever hacks, and more. Regarding contracts level - any smart contracts, i.e. not limited to EVM based.
